## Introduction 

 This project is part of Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program. The aim of the project is to use R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore relationships between one variable to multiple variables and to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies.    
 
 The analysis should be almost like a stream-of-consciousness as you ask questions, create visualizations, and explore your data. This project is open-ended in that there is not one right answer. As John Tukey stated, "The combination of some data and an aching desire for an answer does not ensure that a reasonable answer can be extracted from a given body of data."     

## Project Workspace
**WhiteWines.rmd:** The RMD file containing the analysis (final plots and summary, and reflection)    
**WhiteWines.html:** the HTML file knitted from the RMD file using the knitr package    
**Data\wineQualityWhites.csv:** the original data set and source     
**Sources.txt:** A list of Web sites used in creating the submission
